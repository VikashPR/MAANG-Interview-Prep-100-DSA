## 🔢 Arrays

Arrays test your ability to handle straightforward data aggregations and transformations.

- **[Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)** ![Easy](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Easy-green)
  - **Concepts**: Hashing, Single-pass solution
  - **Why Important**: Essential for understanding hash table applications in problem-solving.

- **[Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/)** ![Easy](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Easy-green)
  - **Concepts**: Single-pass, Dynamic thinking
  - **Why Important**: Teaches you to find optimal buying and selling points, a common interview problem.

- **[3Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/)** ![Medium](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Medium-yellow)
  - **Concepts**: Two pointers, Sorting
  - **Why Important**: Expands on the two-pointer technique with a more complex problem setting.

- **[Product of Array Except Self](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/)** ![Medium](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Medium-yellow)
  - **Concepts**: Prefix and suffix products
  - **Why Important**: Illustrates space-efficient solutions without using division.

- **[Find the Duplicate Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-duplicate-number/)** ![Hard](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Hard-red)
  - **Concepts**: Cycle detection (Floyd's Tortoise and Hare)
  - **Why Important**: A clever use of algorithms originally designed for linked list cycle detection.

## 🔤 Strings

Dive deep into string manipulation, a key skill for any software engineering interviews.

- **[Longest Repeating Character Replacement](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-repeating-character-replacement/)** ![Medium](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Medium-yellow)
  - **Concepts**: Sliding window, Character count
  - **Why Important**: Tests your ability to maintain state in a sliding window, optimizing for specific conditions.

- **[Minimum Window Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/)** ![Hard](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Hard-red)
  - **Concepts**: Sliding window, Hash map
  - **Why Important**: This problem requires you to manage a dynamic set of requirements as you adjust your window, perfect for testing advanced problem-solving skills.
